### Code Contributions

@Hooking was generous enough to let us reuse the item selector from his game system [Foundry VTT Pathfinder 2e (PF2e)](https://gitlab.com/hooking/foundry-vtt---pathfinder-2e). That piece of code was contributed by `an unkown contributor` on the PF2e game system. MOST of this project has been very heavily influenced by [Foundry VTT Pathfinder 2E](https://gitlab.com/hooking/foundry-vtt---pathfinder-2e). All credit to their previous work and generosity.
