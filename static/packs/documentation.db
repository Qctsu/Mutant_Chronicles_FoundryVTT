For player characters this also affects which attribute is used to add bonus Combat Dice to the roll.</p><p>The Combat Dice input allows you to specify how many base Combat Dice to roll. If the roll is linked to a weapon Item, the Attack Type title is changed to the name of the weapon being used, and the Combat Dice input is disabled as the base damage is taken from the weapon Item definition.</p><p>The Reloads quantity input and Reload selector are only enabled if a Ranged weapon is linked to the roll:</p><img src=\"systems/mc3e/assets/docs/DamageRoll-Reloads.png\" width=\"250\" /><p>All Reloads owned by the Actor will be listed in the selector, which shows how many remain unused. The amount to use can then be specified in the Reloads input.</p><p>If the Actor owns multiple Reload items of the same type, they will be grouped as a single option in the selector, and any used in the roll will be spread amongst all the uses available.</p><h3>Bonus Dice</h3><p>The Other input is used to add any other ad-hoc bonus dice that may be required.</p><p>The Talent input in this section is used to specify any additional damage dice that may come from any Talents or Special Abilities an Actor may have.</p><h3>Bonus Damage</h3><p>This section allows you to spend Doom or Momentum to add bonus damage at a cost of one Doom/Momentum per bonus point of damage.</p><p>Which inputs are enabled in this section depends on the type of Actor performing the roll.</p><p></p><h1>Skill Rolls</h1><p>There are two kinds of Skill Roll dialogue, depending on the way they have been triggered.</p><h2>Basic Skill Rolls</h2><img src=\"systems/mc3e/assets/docs/BasicSkillRoll.png\" width=\"250\" /><p>This Basic Skill Roll can either be triggered using the <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">@UUID[.SGPAnqrTHmzvgKvF#basic-skill-roll]{basicSkillRoll}</span> macro, or by the GM using the <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">@UUID[.SGPAnqrTHmzvgKvF#skill-roll]{skillRoll}</span> macro without an Actor selected.</p><p>This dialogue is designed for quick ad-hoc skill test rolls that aren't linked to any specific Actor.</p><p>There are two sections to this dialogue:</p><h3>Difficulty</h3><p>The Difficulty section consists of six buttons you can click to set the Test Difficulty of the test (the number of successes required to perform that task in question).</p><p>Below this you can set the TN (Target Number), Focus and Complication values as needed.</p><h3>Dice</h3><p>Just below the Difficulty section there is a summary of the test that will be rolled, and five dice icons.</p><p>These dice icons show how many dice will be rolled.

This should be set to the difficulty your GM has specified for the test in question.</p><h3>Attribute and Skill</h3><p>Here you can use the drop-down selectors to choose the character Attribute and Skill to use for the test.</p><p>If this dialogue screen is triggered by clicking on a Skill in the Character Sheet, the correct Attribute and Skill will be pre-selected for you, but the flexibility is there to alter them if required.</p><h3>Dice Purchase</h3><p>The Dice Purchase section is used to spend/pay Fortune, Momentum and/or Doom to add dice to the skill test.</p><p>When this dialogue is used for a Player Character, the Doom input value is how much Doom you will give to the GM to buy additional dice.</p><p>When this dialogue is used for an NPC Actor, the Momentum input is disabled and they can only spend Fortune or Doom to add additional dice.

If an Actor is suffering from any Wounds or Traumas, the test difficulty will automatically be increased for relevant tests (Wounds affect physical skill difficulties, Traumas affect mental skill difficulties) and a warning message will be shown as you can see here:</p><img src=\"systems/mc3e/assets/docs/PlayerSkillTest-Wounded.png\" width=\"250\" /><p>The dice icons show how many dice will currently be rolled.</p><p>If you click the number of dice you wish to roll, the dialogue will automatically try and adjust the Momentum and Doom values to accommodate your desires.

These have be designed to hopefully be as flexible and intuitive as possible.</p><p>All of them tend to share similar controls for modifying values for dice or other bonuses used by the rolls they are used to trigger.</p><h2>Quantity Value Controls</h2><p>All the dice roller interfaces contain controls like the one shown below. These are used to adjust numbers of dice, or general bonuses and/or resource spends:</p><img src=\"systems/mc3e/assets/docs/RollQuantityDialogs.png\" /><p>On certain dice roll interfaces some of these inputs may be disabled. These are not editable for a variety of reasons, which will be detailed in the dialogue specific documentation below.</p><p>The controls for these inputs all work in the same way:</p><ul><li><p>A <strong>Left Mouse Click</strong> on the <strong>\"+\"</strong> button will increase the value.</p></li><li><p>A <strong>Left Mouse</strong> Click on the \"-\" button will decrease the value.</p></li><li><p>Scrolling the <strong>Mouse Wheel</strong> <strong>Up/Down</strong> over the number will increase/decrease the value.</p></li></ul><p>Where the values being controlled are tied to limited resources, the maximum values you can increase them too may be limited.</p><p></p><h1>Combat Dice Rolls</h1><p>There are several dialogues related to Combat Dice. A general Combat Dice roller, a Damage roller and a Soak roller.</p><h2>Combat Dice</h2><img src=\"systems/mc3e/assets/docs/CombatDice.png\" /><p>This basic Combat Dice roller can be triggered by the <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">@UUID[.SGPAnqrTHmzvgKvF#combat-dice-roll]{combatDiceRoll} </span>macro and simply allows you to roll a specified number of Combat Dice.</p><h2>Damage Roll</h2><img src=\"systems/mc3e/assets/docs/DamageRoll-Basic.png\" width=\"250\" /><p>The Damage Roll dialogue can be triggered either by using the Damage button on a weapon Item on the Character Sheet or Item Chat message, or by using the <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">@UUID[.SGPAnqrTHmzvgKvF#damage-roll]{damageRoll}</span> macro.</p><p>The Damage Roll dialogue works differently depending on whether it is linked to a weapon Item or not.</p><h3>Attack Type</h3><p>The three buttons can be used to switch between the different attack types. For player characters this also affects which attribute is used to add bonus Combat Dice to the roll.</p><p>The Combat Dice input allows you to specify how many base Combat Dice to roll. If the roll is linked to a weapon Item, the Attack Type title is changed to the name of the weapon being used, and the Combat Dice input is disabled as the base damage is taken from the weapon Item definition.</p><p>The Reloads quantity input and Reload selector are only enabled if a Ranged weapon is linked to the roll:</p><img src=\"systems/mc3e/assets/docs/DamageRoll-Reloads.png\" width=\"250\" /><p>All Reloads owned by the Actor will be listed in the selector, which shows how many remain unused. The amount to use can then be specified in the Reloads input.</p><p>If the Actor owns multiple Reload items of the same type, they will be grouped as a single option in the selector, and any used in the roll will be spread amongst all the uses available.</p><h3>Bonus Dice</h3><p>The Other input is used to add any other ad-hoc bonus dice that may be required.</p><p>The Talent input in this section is used to specify any additional damage dice that may come from any Talents or Special Abilities an Actor may have.</p><h3>Bonus Damage</h3><p>This section allows you to spend Doom or Momentum to add bonus damage at a cost of one Doom/Momentum per bonus point of damage.</p><p>Which inputs are enabled in this section depends on the type of Actor performing the roll.</p><p></p><h1>Skill Rolls</h1><p>There are two kinds of Skill Roll dialogue, depending on the way they have been triggered.</p><h2>Basic Skill Rolls</h2><img src=\"systems/mc3e/assets/docs/BasicSkillRoll.png\" width=\"250\" /><p>This Basic Skill Roll can either be triggered using the <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">@UUID[.SGPAnqrTHmzvgKvF#basic-skill-roll]{basicSkillRoll}</span> macro, or by the GM using the <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">@UUID[.SGPAnqrTHmzvgKvF#skill-roll]{skillRoll}</span> macro without an Actor selected.</p><p>This dialogue is designed for quick ad-hoc skill test rolls that aren't linked to any specific Actor.</p><p>There are two sections to this dialogue:</p><h3>Difficulty</h3><p>The Difficulty section consists of six buttons you can click to set the Test Difficulty of the test (the number of successes required to perform that task in question).</p><p>Below this you can set the TN (Target Number), Focus and Complication values as needed.</p><h3>Dice</h3><p>Just below the Difficulty section there is a summary of the test that will be rolled, and five dice icons.</p><p>These dice icons show how many dice will be rolled. You can click on the number of dice you wish to roll, and the dice images will be updated accordingly.</p><p>If you select only one die, the Test Difficulty will be disabled and an Assist Roll will be rolled instead of a Skill Test.</p><h2>Character Skill Rolls</h2><img src=\"systems/mc3e/assets/docs/PlayerSkillTest.png\" width=\"250\" /><p>Unlike the Basic Skill Roll detailed above, this roll is linked to a specific Actor (their name is show in the dialog title) and has a few more sections:</p><h3>Difficulty</h3><p>As with the Basic Skill Roll dialog, the Difficulty section consists of six buttons you can click to set the Test Difficulty of the test. This should be set to the difficulty your GM has specified for the test in question.</p><h3>Attribute and Skill</h3><p>Here you can use the drop-down selectors to choose the character Attribute and Skill to use for the test.</p><p>If this dialogue screen is triggered by clicking on a Skill in the Character Sheet, the correct Attribute and Skill will be pre-selected for you, but the flexibility is there to alter them if required.</p><h3>Dice Purchase</h3><p>The Dice Purchase section is used to spend/pay Fortune, Momentum and/or Doom to add dice to the skill test.</p><p>When this dialogue is used for a Player Character, the Doom input value is how much Doom you will give to the GM to buy additional dice.</p><p>When this dialogue is used for an NPC Actor, the Momentum input is disabled and they can only spend Fortune or Doom to add additional dice. Creating a Fortune spend for an NPC costs 3 Doom.</p><p>Altering any of these values, will alter the number of dice rolled on the test (up to a maximum of five), and the total number of dice to be rolled will be reflected in the dice shown at the bottom of the Dialogue.</p><h3>Bonus</h3><p>This section is used for various bonuses that may apply to this roll due to Talents, Special Abilities or the whims of the GM.</p><p>The D20 input will add any additional dice to the roll that do not need to be paid for with Fortune, Momentum or Doom, up to the maximum dice count of five as with the Dice Purchase section.</p><p>The Momentum input allow you to specify any additional Momentum you should receive has part of a successful test.</p><p>The Success input allows you to specify any additional automatic successes that are included in the result.</p><h3>Dice</h3><p>Just below the Difficulty section there is a summary of the test that will be rolled. If an Actor is suffering from any Wounds or Traumas, the test difficulty will automatically be increased for relevant tests (Wounds affect physical skill difficulties, Traumas affect mental skill difficulties) and a warning message will be shown as you can see here:</p><img src=\"systems/mc3e/assets/docs/PlayerSkillTest-Wounded.png\" width=\"250\" /><p>The dice icons show how many dice will currently be rolled.</p><p>If you click the number of dice you wish to roll, the dialogue will automatically try and adjust the Momentum and Doom values to accommodate your desires. In the case of a player character, it will always use any available Momentum to pay for the extra dice before it will use Doom.</p><p>The dialog will never automatically use anything other than Doom and/or Momentum for this purpose.</p><p>If the way it allocates resources to the dice purchases is not to your liking, you can then adjust the quantity inputs accordingly.</p><p>If you select only one die, the Test Difficulty will be disabled and an Assist Roll will be rolled instead of a Skill Test.</p><p></p><h1>Soak Rolls</h1><img src=\"systems/mc3e/assets/docs/SoakRoll.png\" width=\"250\" /><p>The Soak Rolls dialog is fairly straightforward, and it is triggered by either clicking on Shield Soak button on an Item that has the Shield X quality, or using one of the three provided Macros: <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">@UUID[.SGPAnqrTHmzvgKvF#cover-soak-roll]{coverSoakDiceRoll}</span>, <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">@UUID[.SGPAnqrTHmzvgKvF#morale-soak-roll]{moraleSoakDiceRoll}</span> or <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">@UUID[.SGPAnqrTHmzvgKvF#soak-dice-roll]{soakDiceRoll}</span>.</p><p>Each of these show basically the same dialogue.</p><h3>Type</h3><p>The Type section allows you to specify what type of Soak you are rolling.  This makes no mechanical difference, and just affects the names of the Presets in the section below, and the wording used on the results Chat card.</p><h3>Presets</h3><p>Each Type of Soak roll has two presets which provide default a Soak Dice input value.  Other than that they only affect the wording on the results Chat card.</p><img src=\"systems/mc3e/assets/docs/SoakRoll-MoralePreset.png\" width=\"250\" /><h3>Soak Dice</h3><p>This input is the number of Combat Dice that would be rolled for the Soak test.
